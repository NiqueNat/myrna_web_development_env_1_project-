        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>As an online student I have be resilient and determined as a key factors in success. Adult learners face many obstacles and setbacks, such as work and family responsibilities, financial constraints, and personal challenges. However, as a resilient learner, I can overcome these obstacles and persist in my studies. I am able to adapt to changing circumstances and seek out support and resources when needed. 
        <br>    
        Determined learners are those who remain focused on their goals and are willing to put in the time and effort required to achieve them. I am not deterred by setbacks or failures and can learn from my mistakes.</p>
